## Kubernetes Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Kubernetes-based deployment designed to showcase containerized application deployment, internet exposure, and persistent storage management. The repository covers:

- Deployment of applications using appropriate Kubernetes objects.
- Internet traffic routing using Kubernetes services.
- Handling of persistent storage for application data.
- Git workflow for continuous development and deployment.
- Debugging and application testing for production readiness.

### Objectives Covered
1. **Choice of Kubernetes Objects**
2. **Exposure of Pods to Internet Traffic**
3. **Persistent Storage Management**
4. **Git Workflow**
5. **Application Testing and Debugging**
6. **Good Practices in Docker Image Management**

### Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
