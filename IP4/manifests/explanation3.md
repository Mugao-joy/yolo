## Detailed Explanation of Implementation

### 1. Choice of Kubernetes Objects
**Reasoning:** 
- **Deployment vs. StatefulSet:** Deployments were chosen for stateless applications as they ensure scalability and rolling updates. StatefulSets were avoided for non-storage-heavy components to minimize overhead.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets:** Used for managing application configuration and sensitive data, ensuring secure and dynamic updates.

### 2. Method to Expose Pods to Internet Traffic
**Reasoning:**
- **LoadBalancer Service:** Selected for external traffic exposure due to its simplicity and integration with cloud provider load balancers.
- **Ingress Controller:** Considered for applications requiring advanced routing but omitted for simplicity in single-entry-point scenarios.

### 3. Persistent Storage Management
**Reasoning:**
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** Used where data persistence is critical, ensuring storage remains available across pod restarts.
- **EmptyDir:** Used for temporary data storage where persistence is unnecessary.

### 4. Git Workflow
**Reasoning:**
- **Feature Branching:** Ensured isolated development for new features.
- **Pull Requests:** Allowed peer review before merging to the main branch.
- **Tagging Releases:** Ensured clarity and version control in deployments.

### 5. Application Testing and Debugging
- Verified application availability via the provided URL.
- Debugged using logs (`kubectl logs`) and pod inspection (`kubectl describe pod`).
- Fixed deployment errors by reviewing YAML manifest files and applying corrections iteratively.

### 6. Good Practices
- **Docker Image Tags:** Followed the `app-name:version-date` convention to simplify image tracking and rollback.
- **Resource Limits:** Defined `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` to ensure efficient cluster utilization.
