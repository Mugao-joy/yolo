Explanation of Implementation
This document outlines the rationale and approach taken to containerize the e-commerce project, detailing choices, implementations, and best practices.
==========================================================================================================
1. Choice of the Base Image
I chose alpine because it would take less space and is lightweight - mugaojoy/mugao-yolo-backend        v1.0.0    022c5eecd9c3   52 minutes ago      89.4MB
mugaojoy/mugao-yolo-client         v1.0.0    e8bed7f995a2   About an hour ago   310MB

 1. Client:`node:16-alpine3.16`
 2. Backend: `node:16-alpine3.16`
 3.Mongo : `mongo:6.0 `
============================================================================================================

2. Dockerfile directives used in the creation and running of each container.
mugaojoy-mugao-yolo-backend (for the server side)
mugaojoy-mugao-yolo-client(client side/frontend)

=============================================================================================================
3. Docker-compose Networking (Application port allocation and a bridge network implementation) where necessary.
4. Docker-compose volume definition and usage (where necessary).
5. Git workflow used to achieve the task.
=========================================================================================================
6. Successful running of the applications and if not, debugging measures applied.

    -----I was getting a node version error that was preventing the client side from running locally and instead of downgrading the node bersion i used the following command----------
        export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
        npm start

    --------for the database i Used the official MongoDB Docker image: No additional setup is needed since MongoDBâ€™s image is prebuilt.----------
==========================================================================================================
7. Good practices such as Docker image tag naming standards for ease of identification of images and containers. 
-good naming system using v1.0.0.0 
8. There is a screenshot of your deployed image on DockerHub, clearly showing the version of the image

export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
npm start
